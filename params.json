{"name":"Arduino Exosite Library","tagline":"Arduino library for Exosite IoT Platform read/write/probision","body":"About the Exosite Arduino Library\r\n=================================\r\nThis library allows you to quickly and easily connect your [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) project to Exosite's Data Platform in the cloud. It connects your project using an Arduino Ethernet shield, Arduino WiFi Shield, or any other networking shield that subclasses the Client class. See the examples folder for both an Ethernet and a WiFi example.\r\n\r\nNote: A free account on exosite portals is required: https://portals.exosite.com\r\n\r\nLicense is BSD, Copyright 2013, Exosite LLC (see LICENSE file)\r\n\r\nTested with Arduino 1.0.5 and 1.5.5\r\n\r\n![image](extras/ArduinoUno_R3_Front_450px.jpg)\r\n\r\nHelp\r\n====\r\nTroubleshooting information and help can be in the Exosite Community Forum.\r\n\r\n[Community Forum](https://community.exosite.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\n* Arduino IDE must be installed on your computer [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/software)\r\n* Need an internet enabled Arduino system, which is typically done by adding a Ethernet or WiFi.\r\n* Note: Cellular shields typically will not work with this library as is.  They typically require direct AT commands sent to open sockets, send date, etc. The libraries code can be used as reference for what needs to be sent over the modem connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n==========\r\nArduino IDE v1.6.2 or greater\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nNewer versions of the Arduino IDE include a Library Manager GUI that you can use to easily install the Exosite library. Simply open the Library Manager:\r\n![image](extras/LibraryManager_1.png) \r\n Next, search for and install the Exosite library:\r\n![image](extras/LibraryManager_Exosite.png)\r\nWhen updates are pushed to this repository, return to this interface if you would like to update the Exosite library to the newer version.\r\n\r\nEarlier versions of the Arduino IDE\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install this library with earlier versions of the Arduino IDE is to simply clone this repo straight to your libraries folder.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd ~/sketchbook/libraries\r\ngit clone https://github.com/exosite-garage/arduino_exosite_library.git Exosite\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you would rather not use the command line or you don't have git installed, click the download button on the right hand side of this page and choose to open the ZIP. Copy the contained folder to your Arduino IDE's libraries folder (inside your sketchbook folder) and Rename it to \"Exosite\". If you do not know the location of sketchbook folder click on \"File->Preferences\" in the IDE and you should see it listed.\r\n\r\nNote: You will need to restart the Arduino IDE after installing the library.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n========\r\nThis library includes examples, which will be available in the Arduino IDE 'Examples' menu directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterface\r\n=========\r\n\r\nConstructor\r\n-----------\r\n```cpp\r\nExosite(Client *_client);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nExosite(char *_cik, Client *_client);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nExosite(String _cik, Client *_client);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`_cik`: This is used to hard code the CIK into the device can either be a `char[]` or a `String` type. This parameter can be omitted when using provisioning.\r\n\r\n`_client`: This is the interface to what ever network device you're using. Must be a subclass of [`Client`](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/ClientConstructor) such as: [`EthernetClient`](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/EthernetClient), [`WiFiClient`](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiClient), or [`YunClient`](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/YunClientConstructor).\r\n\r\nwriteRead\r\n---------\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nboolean Exosite::writeRead(char* writeString, char* readString, char** returnString);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nboolean Exosite::writeRead(String writeString, String readString, String &returnString);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`writeString`: This sets the values to write to certain datasources. eg. \"alias3=value3&alias4=value4\"\r\n\r\n`readString`: This selects which datasources to read by their alias. eg. \"alias1&alias2\"\r\n\r\n`returnstring`: This is the string returned with the values requested in `readString`. eg. \"alias1=value1&alias2=value2\"\r\n\r\nprovision\r\n---------\r\n```cpp\r\nboolean Exosite::provision(char* vendorString, char* modelString, char* snString);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`vendorString`: The string that identifies the device vendor name.\r\n\r\n`modelString`: The string that identifies the device unique model ID.\r\n\r\n`snString`: The string that identifies the device's serial number.\r\n\r\nbegin (ESP8266 Only)\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid Exosite::begin();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMust be called before any other library calls, but after `EEPROM.begin()` when using provisioning.\r\n\r\nUse only if using the following constructor:\r\n```cpp\r\nExosite(Client *_client);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMigration from V1\r\n=================\r\nVersion 2 no longer sets up the ethernet shield for you. In your code you'll need to replace `Exosite exosite(&Ethernet, macData, cikData);` with \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass EthernetClient client;\r\nExosite exosite(cikData, &client);\r\n```\r\nYou will also need to remove `exosite.init();` and add `Ethernet.begin(macData);` to your setup() function.\r\n\r\nRelease Info\r\n============\r\n**v2.3.7 - Release 2015-09-16**\r\n - Make ESP8266OccupancySensor example use provisioning and update readme\r\n\r\n**v2.3.6 - Release 2015-09-03**\r\n - Add method `Exosite::begin()` for ESP8266 boards only to be used after `EEPROM.begin()` to fix provisioning scenarios\r\n\r\n**v2.3.5 - Release 2015-08-18**\r\n - Removed `Serial.print()` statements in `fetchNVCIK()` to prevent printing to serial port before `Serial.begin()`\r\n\r\n**v2.3.4 - Release 2015-08-10**\r\n - Fixed `time()` function, actually returns time now.\r\n - Added example to use `time()`.\r\n - Added library.properties for new IDE versions.\r\n\r\n**v2.3.3 - Release 2015-04-20**\r\n - Pushed missing commits from previous release.\r\n - Put memory debugging stuff behind special ifdef.\r\n\r\n**v2.3.2 - Release 2015-03-05**\r\n - Added `client->stop()` before `client->connect()` to activate and timestamp too.\r\n - Clarified some serial debug statements.\r\n - Check that CIK is 40 hex characters on seemingly successful activation before blowing away old CIK.\r\n\r\n**v2.3.1 - Release 2014-09-17**\r\n - Added `client->stop()` before `client->connect()`, the Ethernet shield seems to need this or `connect()` does nothing.\r\n\r\n**v2.3.0 - Release 2014-09-11**\r\n - Added EEPROM includes back to all examples.\r\n - Now leaving socket open between requests.\r\n - Merged PR from DrewJaworskiRIS to wrap char string in String object constructor before returning.

User must now URL encode and decode their own data.\r\n - Made compatible with Arduino WiFi shield (and anything that similarly subclasses the Client class).\r\n - Updated examples to use new interface.\r\n\r\n**v1.1 - Release 2013-07-29**\r\n - Major rewrite to both read and write multiple datasources in one HTTP call.\r\n - Removed all use of Strings due to stability issues (except for manipulating string object passed to existing functions).\r\n - Existing `sendToCloud()` and `readFromCloud()` changed to use new call internally. External Interface Unchanged\r\n\r\n**v1.0 - Release 2011-06-05**\r\n - initial version\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
